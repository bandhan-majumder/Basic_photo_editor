there are 3 types of basic image..
1. black and white ( 0 and 1)
2. greyscale (between 0 and 255)
3. colored image ( red, green, blue channel)

# difference between colored image and grayscale image
    Colored (RGB) Image:
        In a colored image, each pixel is represented by three color channels: Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B).
        Each channel has intensity values ranging from 0 to 255, indicating the amount of that particular color. For example, (255, 0, 0) represents pure red, (0, 255, 0) represents pure green, and (0, 0, 255) represents pure blue.
        The combination of these three color channels at each pixel produces a wide range of colors, allowing for the representation of a spectrum of hues.

    Grayscale Image:
        In a grayscale image, each pixel is represented by a single intensity value, typically ranging from 0 to 255.
        The intensity value represents the brightness or luminance of the pixel. A higher intensity value corresponds to a brighter pixel, while a lower intensity value corresponds to a darker pixel.
        Grayscale images are essentially black and white, with shades of gray in between. They lack the color information present in RGB images.
